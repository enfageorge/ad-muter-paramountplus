# AD Auto Muter for Paramount Plus

## Motivation

As a regular user of Paramount Plus, I often enjoy streaming shows in the background while working or as a companion to help me drift off to sleep. However, the abrupt loudness of advertisements are often quite jarring, disrupting my focus during work and sometimes, worse, waking me from a restful sleep. 

## Solution 

To address this issue, I developed a simple Chrome plugin designed to automatically mute these ads, ensuring a smoother, less intrusive streaming experience. This tool serves as a personal solution to enhance my daily routine, allowing me to enjoy uninterrupted background content without the disturbance of loud advertisements.
